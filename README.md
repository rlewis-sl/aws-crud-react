# Getting Started with Vite + React

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as its build tool for a fast and modern development experience.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode with Vite's fast dev server.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload instantly with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) when you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner powered by Vitest.\
Tests run in watch mode by default. Use `npm test -- --run` for a single run.

See the [Vitest documentation](https://vitest.dev/) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run preview`

Locally preview the production build before deploying.\
Serves the built app from the `dist` folder.
